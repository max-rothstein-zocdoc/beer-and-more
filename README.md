# Beer...and more (A Hackathon '19 Project)
Give the people what they want.
## Usage
There are currently two ways of visiting the beer shop.
To visit via the main shop:
```
$ ./start-shop -b
```
To go directly to the beer shop:
```
$ ./beer
```
If you want to visit the shop from elsewhere on your filesystem, feel free to add the shop to your PATH.
## Next Steps
Add more shops.
## Contributing
Got an idea for a shop? Contribute! There are a handy collection of helpers in `root/common.js`. We do ask that all new shops are accessible via `root/start-shop`.

Do you think writing a command line app with JavaScript/nodejs is weird? Want to write your shop in a different language? Have at it! The main shop is a bash script and is happy to reach out to other shops.
